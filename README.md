# Tech Layoffs Post-COVID: A Comprehensive SQL Analysis (2020-2024)


## üéØ Objectives 
This project aims to analyze tech industry layoffs from 2020 to 2024 using SQL to uncover key patterns and insights. It identifies trends such as peak layoff periods, and most affected industries, companies, and countries while enabling a better understanding of the post-COVID impact on workforce dynamics. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for workforce management. 

### KEY COMPONENTS

### Data Cleaning and Standardization:
- Address duplicates, null values, and inconsistent formatting for accurate analysis.
  
### Exploratory Analysis:
- Identify peak layoff periods, regions, industries, and funding stages most affected.
- Detect trends in layoffs by month and year.

### Insight Delivery:
- Highlight actionable patterns, such as resilience in certain industries and regions.

## üìÇ Data Source
- Dataset: Tech Layoffs Dataset
- Source: Kaggle: Tech Layoffs Dataset
- Contents: Details on layoffs, including Company, Location_HQ, Industry, Laid_Off_Count, Date, Source, Funds_Raised, Stage, Date_Added, Country, Percentage, List_of_Employees_Laid_Off
- The cleaned dataset is available here.

## üõ†Ô∏è Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning

**Used SQL operations to**:

- Remove duplicates (ROW_NUMBER, CTE).
- Standardize inconsistent entries (TRIM, replacement of special characters).
- Handle null values by replacing or removing redundant records.
  
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation

- Converted columns to appropriate data types (e.g., dates, numeric formats).
- Aggregated data by regions, industries, and funding stages.
  
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Identified trends using SQL functions:
- Rolling totals (SUM() OVER()).
- Ranking (DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER).
- Year-over-year comparisons and percentage calculations.


## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Amazon (27,840), Meta (21,000), and Tesla (14,500) led layoffs.
Layoffs peaked in 2023 (+40.17% YoY) but declined sharply in 2024 (-63.69%), signaling recovery.
